Yesterday we had a short and sweet tutoring session with [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron?lang=de) and it was AWESOME! Evidence:

Jessica introduced us to Standard Streams, that is Standard out (STDOUT) and Standard in (STDIN).

To keep it very simple - anything else would go beyond the boundaries of our knowledge at this very moment anyways.
We have the computer, the terminal and the shell. If you'd explain it in a very childish way: The shell takes advantage of the terminal to boss around computer - clever ass. 

Once upon a time we, as human beings, all partnered up with the shell in order to talk with the computer.

This image shows one of the first terminals (VT100) and in the terminal runs the program shell. "The terminal is like a TV - it is stupid *(Erik, July 13th 2015)*." It reflect images and other stupid stuff, the actual TV program and brain is shell.
To stress this point: back in the times of the VT100 the shell didn't actually run on it, but was running on a mainframe computer in another room. So the terminal was only responsible for taking keyboard input, sending it to the computer in the other room (over a wire), and displaying the characters that came back from the shell in the other room... it really doesn't know more than getting+sending input and showing characters on the screen.

Nowadays terminals are not external hardware anymore but part of the whole ecosystem on your computer (check it out: type "terminal" in your Spotlight search if you have a Mac). 
STDIN and STDOUT are the two mail boxes via which shell and terminal communicate. STDOUT is where the shell puts stuff out to the terminal e.g. a file and STDOUT is the same thing the other way around. And then you have funny commands which define what/who of the two puts what when in what whenever mailbox and gets it out. Well, I hope you got the idea... 

Eventually, after the shell and terminal have sorted out their mailbox mess, they will let the computer know what to do.
