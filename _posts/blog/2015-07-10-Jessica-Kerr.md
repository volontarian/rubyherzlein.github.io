Yesterday we had a short and sweet tutoring session with [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron?lang=de) and it was AWESOME! Evidence:

Jessica came up with Standard Streams, that is StandardOut (STDOUT) and StandardIn (STDIN).

To keep it very simple - anything else would extend the boundaries of our knowledge at this very moment anyways.
We have the computer, the terminal and the shell. If you'd explain it in a very childish way: Shell takes advantag of terminal to boss around computer - clever ass. 

Once upon a time we, as human beeings, all partnered up with shell in order to talk with the computer. 
This is one of the very first versions: TV100:

This image shows a terminal and in the terminal runs the programm shell. "The terminal is like a TV - it is stupid *(Erik, July 13th 2015)*." The TV program only reflect images and stuff, the actual TV program is shell.

Nowadays terminals are not external hardware anymore but part of the whole ecosystem computer (check it out: type "terminal" in your spotlight search). 
STDIN and STDOUT are the two mail boxes via which shell and terminal communicate. STDIN is where shell puts stuff INside for terminal e.g. a file and STDOUT is the same thing the other way around. And than you have funny commands which define what/who of the two puts what when in what whenever mailbox and gets it out Or. Are they? Yes. Just kidding. Or am I? Well, I guess you got the idea... 

This is not only confusing to us, even terminal and shell mix up stuff all the time and get lost. E.g. type the command Â "cat [enter]" in the terminal --> [dead-end](http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kx9q1aiyd11qzobxio1_r1_500.gif)
