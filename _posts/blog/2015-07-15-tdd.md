These days we are learning about testisng! RSpec is a tool that can be used to implement Test Driven Development (TDD) when you're writing your code in Ruby.
TDD means writing tests and making sure they pass while you write your code.

With TDD, instead of writing a huge chunk of code and only testing if it works at the very end -you test every method along the way. First you write the (failing) test first and only then do you write the actual code necessary to make it pass. This makes you very deliberately build the application at the same time as you test everything. Best of all, it shows you immediately what part of your code is broken and that makes it easier to fix.

RSpec used the terms “describe” and “it” as a way to make you the TDD a little like a conversation. It sounds super easy, but is actually a bit tricky when you're new to programming! We added a couple of links for RSpec resources in the links page,in case you want to learn more.
