Yesterday we had a short and sweet tutoring session with [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron?lang=de) and it was AWESOME! Evidence:

Jessica introduced us to Standard Streams, that is Standard out (STDOUT) and Standard in (STDIN).

To keep it very simple - anything else would go beyond the boundaries of our knowledge at this very moment - we have the computer, the terminal and the shell. How do these things interact? The shell takes advantage of the terminal to boss around computer! 

The terminal is a place that can take your commands, and runs the shell program. Your shell is the reason you can do and see stuff. A terminal without the shell is like a TV without TV channels. In the terminal the shell is the default program. The terminal in itself doesnâ€™t do anything. 

The shell has:

a prompt 
an environment
variables
it remembers your history (when you hit the up commands)
it can do syntax highlighting
command completion
the main thing it does is: it runs commands/programs
It receives return status/code from programs (knows if the program was running successfully)


The earliest computers didn't have a shell, and so people used to communicate their commands to the computer without the smart interactive interface that the shell provides. Luckily for us a single system console was added to allow the operator to communicate with the system in the 1960's.

This image shows one of the first terminals (VT100), where you can see that the terminal runs the program shell. It may look super retro, but you can actually still use the VT100 today!! Back in the days the VT100 shell didn't actually run on the actual computer that people worked with. Instead it was running on a mainframe computer in another room! The terminal was therefore only responsible for taking keyboard input, sending it to the computer in the other room (over a wire), and displaying the characters that came back from the shell in the other room! 

Nowadays terminals are not external hardware anymore but part of the whole ecosystem on your computer (check it out: type "terminal" in your Spotlight search if you have a Mac to say hi to your shell!). 

STDIN and STDOUT are the two mail boxes via which shell and terminal communicate. STDOUT is where the shell puts stuff out to the terminal e.g. a file and STDOUT is the same thing the other way around. And then you have funny commands which define what/who of the two puts what when in what whenever mailbox and gets it out.

Eventually, after the shell and terminal have sorted out their mailbox mess, they will let the computer know what to do.

STDIN-STDOUT-hurly-burly.


THANK YOU JESSICA ;)
