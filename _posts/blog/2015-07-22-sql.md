The first part of this week was dedicated to databases. Databases are for storing and easily accessing large amounts of data. They are good for solving both quantitative and qualitative problems, and can be super powerful. Most apps rely heavily on them to function. In fact, when you look at the world as a programmer, everything is built up by them! 

Programmers used to write code that solved database problems in every imaginable language, but then SQL came and saved the day. SQL - Structured Query Language - literally a database language. 

Today we downloaded SQLite (http://sqlitebrowser.org/) and started creating our first queries using functions such as:
SELECT
COUNT
SUM
And also:
FIRST
LAST
MAX
MIN

In our DB Browser window for SQLite, we first see the databse that we were working on as an example, which has lots of songs:

Next, we see how a query looks, written in the SQL language and the result of the Query "How many pop songs are there?", which returns the answer 5.
